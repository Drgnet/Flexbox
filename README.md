# Flexbox
I started doing these asigments at work without access to my GitHub repos
or accounts, so I was unable to save my progress. They weren't kidding
when they said that Flexbox could get confusing. I'm not sure if it's all
of Flexbox that is confusing, or the fact that all the pieces are starting
to play together to make the whole puzzle, and it gets difficult keeping
the moving parts seperate. I have been really enjoying my journey on into
coding though! I am super excited to dive into JavaScript, and start to
actually get some real coding done!
